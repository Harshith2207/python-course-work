''' Coding Questions '''

Question:
Write a program to calculate and print the sum of all numbers from 1 up to a given number N.
Source code:
            n=int(input())
            total=0
            for i in range(1,n+1):
                total+=i
            print(total)

Question:
Write a Python program that takes n numbers as input (one at a time). Stop taking input and exit the loop immediately if a negative number is entered. Before breaking, print "Negative found".


Question:
Given a list of integers, use a while loop with an else clause to check for the first even number.If an even number is found, print it immediately.If no even number is found, print "No even number".
Source code:
            numbers=list(map(int,input().strip('[]').split(',')))
            i=0
            while i<len(numbers):
                if numbers[i]%2==0:
                    print(numbers[i])
                    break
                i+=1
            else:
                print("No even number")

Question:
Given an integer n, find the first number divisible by 7 in the range from 1 to n (inclusive).Use a while loop with an else clause.Print the number if found.If no such number exists, print "Not Found".
Source code:
            n=int(input())
            i=1
            while i<=n:
                if i%7==0:
                    print(i)
                    break
                i+=1
            else:
                print("Not Found")
